# Phase 3.4 - Child Flow End-to-End Testing

## Test Environment Setup
1. **Backend Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - MySQL: localhost:3306

2. **Frontend Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run web
   ```
   - Web App: http://localhost:8081

3. **Test Users**:
   - Parent: `demoparent` / `demo123`

2. [ ] Try to access protected route
3. [ ] **Verify**:
   - [ ] Redirected to login
   - [ ] Can login again successfully

### 8. Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load times < 2 seconds
- [ ] API responses < 500ms
- [ ] Smooth scrolling in lists
- [ ] No UI freezing during operations
- [ ] Memory usage stable over time

## API Verification Commands

### Full Child Flow Test
```bash
# 1. Login as child
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=demochild&password=child123" 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -o '"access_token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

# 2. Get available chores
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chores/available" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

# 3. Complete a chore (replace CHORE_ID)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chores/{CHORE_ID}/complete" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4. Check balance
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me/balance" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Success Metrics
✅ **Authentication**: Login/logout works correctly
✅ **Chores Display**: All assigned chores visible
✅ **Complete Action**: Chores can be marked complete
✅ **State Management**: UI updates reflect backend state
✅ **Balance Tracking**: Pending amounts shown correctly
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure scenarios
✅ **Performance**: Responsive and fast interactions
✅ **Data Persistence**: State maintained across sessions

## Known Issues / Limitations
1. Parent approval workflow not yet implemented (Phase 4)
2. Adjustments cannot be viewed yet (Phase 4)
3. Completed chores with approval not visible yet
4. No push notifications for approval status

## Phase 3 Completion Summary

### Implemented Features:
1. **Phase 3.1**: Chores listing with tabs (Available/Active/Completed)
2. **Phase 3.2**: Complete chore action with UI feedback
3. **Phase 3.3**: Balance view with detailed breakdown
4. **Phase 3.4**: End-to-end testing and validation

### Technical Achievements:
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Pull-to-refresh on all list views
- Role-based UI components
- Responsive design patterns
- API integration with proper auth
