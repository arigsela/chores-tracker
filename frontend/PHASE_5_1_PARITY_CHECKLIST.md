## Recommendations for Full Parity

### Priority 1 - Critical Gaps
1. Implement child account creation screen
2. Add enable chore button for disabled chores
3. Implement password reset functionality

### Priority 2 - Important Features
1. Add parent self-registration screen
2. Implement potential earnings report
3. Add WebSocket or polling for real-time updates

### Priority 3 - Enhancements
1. Add bulk operations (assign/approve)
2. Implement chore rejection workflow
3. Create chore templates feature

## Conclusion

The React Native Web implementation has achieved **approximately 85% feature parity** with the HTMX version. Most core functionality is working correctly:

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Authentication and role-based access
- Dashboard views for both roles
- Complete chore lifecycle
- Approval workflows
- Adjustments system
- Balance tracking

⚠️ **Partial Implementation:**
- Some administrative features missing
- Real-time updates limited to manual refresh

❌ **Not Implemented:**
- Account management features
- Some reporting features
- Bulk operations

The application is functional for day-to-day use but lacks some administrative features that may be needed for initial setup and maintenance.
