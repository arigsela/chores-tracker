- Create unassigned chores for later assignment
- Edit existing chores
- Set recurring patterns

**Assignment:**
- Assign unassigned chores to children
- Bulk assign multiple chores
- View chores by status (active/pending/completed)

### 3. Approval Workflow ✅
**Pending Approvals:**
- View all chores pending approval
- Filter by child
- See completion timestamps

**Approval Process:**
- Approve fixed reward chores automatically
- Set specific reward value for range chores
- View approval history

### 4. Adjustments System ✅
**Creation:**
- Apply bonuses for good behavior
- Apply deductions for penalties
- Add detailed reasons for each adjustment

- Amount paid out
- Current balance due

**Formula:**
```
Balance = Total Earned + Adjustments - Paid Out
```
