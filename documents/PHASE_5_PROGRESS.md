# Phase 5: Polish and Optimization Progress

## Phase 5.1: Loading States & Error Handling ✅ (Completed)

### Implemented Components:

1. **Skeleton Placeholder Components** (`src/components/common/SkeletonPlaceholder.js`)
   - `SkeletonPlaceholder`: Base animated skeleton component
   - `SkeletonCard`: Pre-configured card skeleton
   - `SkeletonList`: List of skeleton cards
   - `SkeletonText`: Multi-line text skeleton
   - Smooth fade animation using React Native Animated API

2. **Error Boundary** (`src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.js`)
   - Catches JavaScript errors globally
   - Shows user-friendly error screen
   - Retry functionality
   - Dev mode error details

3. **Error Context** (`src/contexts/ErrorContext.js`)
   - Global error state management
   - User-friendly error message mapping
   - Retry callback support
   - Error tracking by key

4. **Network Status Bar** (`src/components/common/NetworkStatusBar.js`)
   - Real-time network connectivity monitoring
   - Animated slide-in/out effect
   - Uses @react-native-community/netinfo

5. **Error View Component** (`src/components/common/ErrorView.js`)
   - Reusable error display component
   - Customizable icon, title, and message
   - Retry button with callback

### Updated Screens:
- **ParentHomeScreen**: Added skeleton loading and error handling
- **ChildHomeScreen**: Added skeleton loading and error handling
- **App.tsx**: Integrated ErrorBoundary, ErrorProvider, and NetworkStatusBar

### Error Message Mappings:
- Network errors → "No internet connection. Please check your network."
- 401 Unauthorized → "Session expired. Please login again."
- 403 Forbidden → "You don't have permission to perform this action."
- 404 Not Found → "The requested item could not be found."
- 500 Server Error → "Something went wrong. Please try again later."
- Default → "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again."

## Phase 5.2: UI Polish & Animations (Pending)
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between screens
- [ ] Animate chore card interactions (complete, approve)
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh animations
- [ ] Success/error toast notifications
- [ ] Micro-interactions (button press feedback)

---

## Phase 5.3: Form Validation & UX Improvements (Pending)
- [ ] Real-time form validation with helpful messages
- [ ] Input field focus management
- [ ] Keyboard avoiding views
- [ ] Auto-dismiss keyboard on scroll
- [ ] Consistent empty states across all screens
- [ ] Better date/time pickers for iOS

---

## Phase 5.4: App Icon & Splash Screen ✅ (Completed)

### Implemented:

1. **App Display Name Updated**:
   - iOS: Changed from "ChoresTrackerMobile" to "Chores Tracker" in Info.plist
   - Android: Updated app_name in strings.xml

2. **Custom Splash Screen Component**:
   - Created `SplashScreen.js` with app branding
   - Shows app icon, title, and loading indicator
   - Integrated into AppNavigator for auth loading state

3. **App Icon Configuration**:
   - Generated iOS icon configuration (Contents.json)
   - Created SVG template for app icon design
   - Set up icon sizes for all required iOS resolutions

4. **Icon Sizes Required** (for designer/tool generation):
   - 40x40px (20pt @2x)
   - 60x60px (20pt @3x)
   - 58x58px (29pt @2x)
   - 87x87px (29pt @3x)
   - 80x80px (40pt @2x)
   - 120x120px (40pt @3x, 60pt @2x)
   - 180x180px (60pt @3x)
   - 1024x1024px (App Store)

### Notes:
- Actual PNG icon files need to be generated using a design tool
- The splash screen is now shown during app initialization
- App branding is consistent across iOS and Android

---

## Phase 5.5: Performance Optimization (Pending)
- [ ] Implement FlatList optimizations (getItemLayout, keyExtractor)
- [ ] Image caching for avatars/icons
- [ ] Reduce re-renders with React.memo
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Profile and fix any memory leaks

---

## Technical Notes:

### Dependencies Added:
- `@react-native-community/netinfo`: For network connectivity monitoring

### Best Practices Applied:
1. **Loading States**: Using skeleton screens instead of spinners for better perceived performance
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms
3. **Network Awareness**: Clear indication when offline
4. **Error Messages**: User-friendly language instead of technical jargon
5. **Accessibility**: Error states include clear descriptions and actions

### Next Steps:
1. Extend skeleton loading to other screens (RewardsScreen, ApprovalQueueScreen, etc.)
2. Implement toast notifications for success/error feedback
3. Add animations for smoother user experience
4. Create reusable form validation hooks
