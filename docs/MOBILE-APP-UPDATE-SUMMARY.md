# Mobile App Update Implementation Summary

**Date**: January 2, 2025  
**Purpose**: Sync React Native mobile app with recent backend enhancements

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The chores-tracker backend recently added two major features that need to be implemented in the mobile app:

1. **Child Balance Display** - Children can now see their actual balance (not just potential rewards)
2. **Reward Adjustments** - Parents can manually add/deduct from children's balances with reasons

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### What's Missing in Mobile App

| Feature | Backend Status | Mobile Status | Priority |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Balance field in user object | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Not fetched | HIGH |
| Balance display for children | ✅ API ready | ❌ Shows wrong data | HIGH |
| Adjustment creation | ✅ API ready | ❌ Not implemented | HIGH |
| Adjustment history | ✅ API ready | ❌ Not implemented | MEDIUM |
| Real-time sync | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not implemented | MEDIUM |

### Key Backend Changes
- User model now includes `balance` field
- New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/users/me/balance` (children only)
- New endpoints: `POST /adjustments/`, `GET /adjustments/child/{id}`
- Balance = Earnings + Adjustments - Paid Out

## 🚀 Implementation Approach

### Design Principles (LEVER Framework)
- **L**everage: 80%+ code reuse from existing components
- **E**xtend: Build on current auth and API patterns
- **V**erify: Maintain role-based security
- **E**liminate: Remove duplicate calculations
- **R**educe: Only 3-4 new components needed

### Phased Delivery

#### Phase 1: Balance Display (Week 1) ⭐ CRITICAL
- Update user data model to include balance
- Create BalanceCard component
- Replace "Potential Rewards" with actual balance
- Add balance refresh on chore completion

**Deliverable**: Children see correct balance

#### Phase 2: Adjustment Features (Week 2) ⭐ CRITICAL  
- Create adjustment service
- Build adjustment modal with validation
- Add "Adjust Balance" to parent screens
- Implement adjustment history view

**Deliverable**: Parents can adjust balances

#### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Week 3)
- Add animations and haptic feedback
- Implement offline support
- Optimize performance
- Complete test coverage

**Deliverable**: Production-ready app

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### New Components (3 total)
1. **BalanceCard** - Displays current balance with animation
2. **AdjustmentModal** - Form for creating adjustments
3. **AdjustmentHistoryScreen** - List of past adjustments

### Modified Files (8 total)
- `authService.js` - Add balance refresh method
- `authContext.js` - Add balance state management
- `ChildHomeScreen.js` - Replace rewards with balance
- `ChildManagementScreen.js` - Add adjustment button
- Plus 4 other minor updates

### API Integration
```javascript
// New endpoints to integrate
ADJUSTMENTS: {
  CREATE: '/adjustments/',
  LIST_BY_CHILD: (childId) => `/adjustments/child/${childId}`,
}
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ✅ Children see current balance within 2 seconds
- ✅ Balance updates immediately after chore approval
- ✅ Parents can adjust balance in < 10 seconds
- ✅ 80%+ code reuse achieved
- ✅ Zero breaking changes

## ⏱️ Timeline & Resources

| Phase | Duration | Effort | Risk |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| Phase 1 | 5 days | 30 hours | Low |
| Phase 2 | 5 days | 35 hours | Low |
| Phase 3 | 5 days | 25 hours | Low |
| Testing | 5 days | 30 hours | Low |
| **Total** | **4 weeks** | **120 hours** | **Low** |
