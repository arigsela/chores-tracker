# DEVOPS Ticket: Multi-Assignment Chores Feature

**Ticket Number**: DEVOPS-MULTI-ASSIGNMENT
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Status**: Planning
**Assignee**: Development Team
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 24-32 hours

---

## üìã Overview

### Objective
Implement support for multiple chore assignment patterns to better reflect real family dynamics:
1. **Single Assignment**: One child assigned to a chore (existing behavior)
2. **Multi-Independent**: Multiple children assigned, each completes independently (e.g., "Clean your room")
3. **Unassigned Pool**: No initial assignee, any child can claim and complete (e.g., "Walk the dog")

### Business Value
- More flexible chore management for families
- Better representation of shared household responsibilities
- Supports both personal chores (room cleaning) and communal chores (pet care)

### Technical Approach
- Add `chore_assignments` junction table for many-to-many relationship
- Add `assignment_mode` field to chores table
- Refactor service layer to handle assignment-level completion tracking
- Update API endpoints to support multiple assignees

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single Assignment (Backward Compatible)
1. Parent creates chore with `assignment_mode='single'`, one child
2. Child sees chore in available list
3. Child marks complete
4. Parent sees in pending approval
5. Parent approves
6. Child's balance increases
7. After cooldown, chore becomes available again

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Independent (Personal Chores)
1. Parent creates "Clean your room" with `assignment_mode='multi_independent'`, 3 kids
2. All 3 kids see chore in their available list
3. Alice marks complete (Bob and Charlie still see it)
4. Parent approves Alice's completion
5. Alice's balance increases, her assignment enters cooldown
6. Bob and Charlie can still complete theirs
7. Parent approves Bob's completion independently
8. After cooldown, each child's assignment resets independently

#### Scenario 3: Unassigned Pool (Shared Chores)
1. Parent creates "Walk the dog" with `assignment_mode='unassigned'`, no assignees
2. All children in family see it in "Available Pool"
3. Alice marks complete (claims it)
4. Bob and Charlie no longer see it
5. Parent approves Alice's completion
6. Alice's balance increases
7. After cooldown, assignment deleted, returns to pool for anyone

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- MySQL database running
- Python 3.11+
- All dependencies installed

### Deployment Steps
1. Stop application server
2. Run Alembic migration: `alembic upgrade head`
3. Verify migration: Check tables exist
4. Start application server
5. Smoke test: Create chore in each mode
6. Monitor logs for errors

### Rollback Plan
Since we're starting from scratch (no data migration), rollback is:
1. Stop application server
2. Run: `alembic downgrade -1`
3. Deploy previous application version
4. Start application server

## üìù Technical Notes

### Assignment Mode Rules

| Mode | Assignees Required | Completion Tracking | Cooldown Scope |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `single` | Exactly 1 | Per-assignment | Per-child |
| `multi_independent` | 1 or more | Per-assignment | Per-child |
| `unassigned` | 0 (initially) | Per-assignment (created on claim) | Per-chore (assignment deleted after cooldown) |

### Database Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_assignments_chore ON chore_assignments(chore_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignments_assignee ON chore_assignments(assignee_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignments_completed ON chore_assignments(is_completed);
CREATE INDEX idx_chores_mode ON chores(assignment_mode);
```

### API Versioning
This change maintains backward compatibility at the API level:
- Old clients can continue using single-assignment pattern
- New clients can leverage multi-assignment features
- No breaking changes to existing endpoints
