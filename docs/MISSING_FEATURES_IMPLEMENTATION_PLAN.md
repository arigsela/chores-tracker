## Technical Considerations

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Add rejection reason to chores
ALTER TABLE chores ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT NULL;

-- Create activities table for activity logging
CREATE TABLE activities (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    activity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSON NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_user_created ON activities(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_chores_rejection ON chores(rejection_reason);
```

### API Endpoints to Add
```
POST   /api/v1/chores/{id}/reject
GET    /api/v1/activities/recent
GET    /api/v1/reports/allowance-summary
GET    /api/v1/users/{id}/reward-history
GET    /api/v1/reports/export/{format}
POST   /api/v1/reports/export
```

### Frontend Components to Create
- `RejectChoreModal` - Rejection reason input
- `ActivityFeedComponent` - Recent activities display
- `AllowanceSummaryPage` - Financial reporting dashboard
- `RewardHistoryView` - Child earnings history
- `ExportButton` - Data export functionality

### Security Considerations
- Ensure rejection reasons are properly sanitized
- Validate user permissions for all new endpoints
- Implement rate limiting on export endpoints
- Add audit logging for financial operations
